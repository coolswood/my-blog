> After a hard day's work, on my way home I decide to stop by the grocery store. Averting my eyes fearfully and stammering out the unfamiliar sounds of a foreign language: 
>
> \- “Тере, кас те саксите милле мууа будел ветт?” (Hello, could you sell me a bottle of water?).
>
> Of course, my ridiculous attempt fails, my pronunciation giving me away. 
>
> \- Joo pudelist, vene siga! (Drink from the puddle, you Russian swine!) - Without even looking at me, the salesman answers contemptuously. 
>
> Smearing tears and snot on my cheeks, I run out into the street. I have to hurry, curfew starts in just 30 minutes, and it's a long way to the Russian ghetto.
> "But I live in a democratic Europe," I say to myself quietly under my breath so that no one hears Russian, and I increase my pace.

This seems to be the picture you get in your head if you only get information from the Russian media 😀. Reality is, as usual, more multifaceted. Let me try to describe my experience and impressions about live in one of the "Russophobic" European country - Estonia.

A little disposition, at first. I left Russia in 2020, even before the war and all of this time a was living in the capital of Estonia - Tallinn. The living place is important and you below you will understand why. My story should divide into before and after.

### Attitude before the war

Back when I was just thinking about moving, many acquaintances dissuaded me, saying that Russians were hated there. The stupidity of this judgment can be felt as soon as you cross the border. The first city on your way is Narva, it's the most pro-Russian city in Estonia, I think that most people here have never even spoken Estonian. But it's a border town, and our way goes to the heart of the country - the capital!

In Tallinn, too, a lot of people understand Russian or only know Russian. In any store or cafe, you can easily explain yourself to the staff. Naturally, young people often do not learn the language of their aggressive neighbor and understand only the simplest phrases (about the same level as in Russia know English). However, fraternization is also very common. I have met people who grew up here in Russian-speaking families, but in Estonian they can understand only a few basic phrases.

In general, the size of the country has a very strong influence on its culture. Estonia has a strong cultural and linguistic influence from its neighbors. This also leads to a high level of tolerance and acceptance of other cultures.

To summarize the state of attitudes towards Russians, it's very unlikely that you'll encounter any kind of infringement at all in your everyday life. This is so if only because you, as a Russian, cannot be distinguished from a Russian-speaking Estonian.

I asked several immigrant friends to recall instances of harassment, the most egregious of which I will tell you. Before work, a friend of mine always goes to buy breakfast at the same store. There is an elderly saleswoman working in the stall. He has always spoken to her in Russian and had no problems, but at some point she decided to forget Russian. Since then she listens to his orders, does everything, but answers only in Estonian. This is such a funny demarche, whether or not to classify it in the category of Russophobia is up to you to decide.

**So there's no Russophobia at all?** In fact, some people probably have some resentment. For me, it's completely understandable. Just imagine if 40% of the population in Moscow didn't speak Russian, followed their traditions, and had no intention of assimilating, and you can understand how a native Estonian might feel.

I immediately remember the <a href="https://novayagazeta.ru/articles/2021/12/16/my-russkii-znaem-dazhe-luchshe" target="_blank">scandal in Moscow</a>, when they started duplicating the inscriptions on the doors of some subway exits in Tajik and Uzbek. There were so many screams that it's too much, and they should learn Russian now that they're here! It is worth thinking how tolerant we are living in Russia.

### Attitude after the outbreak of war

I think this part is the most interesting for the reader. Now surely my story from the beginning of the article is gradually coming to life... Well, yes and no.

In my opinion, nothing has changed at all in the everyday relations between people. The Russian language has not gone out of use, you will not be looked at obliquely for speaking it.

But there have been changes at the level of state relations. Legally, they are cutting off the oxygen to Russians, and it is very noticeable. Now it's no longer possible to get a residence permit to work if you didn't have one before. It is impossible to have a business here if the management is Russian. Everything that concerns the movement of money to and from Russia is also very difficult.

Personally, I recently managed to renew my residence permit in connection with the transition to a new job, but it was not easy for me morally. My application is considered for several months, and, if denied, I would have to leave the country. In my case everything went well.

But there is an example of the opposite situation. My colleague is from Russia, she studied here for 4 years on a visa and already got a job, but did not have time to make a residence permit before the war. She tried to go my way, but was rejected. In 5 months, she will leave Estonia, the country where she has lived for a total of 5 years.

Can this be called discrimination? The short answer is yes, it is, it is classic nationality discrimination at the level of the state. Unfortunately, people are often guided not by reason but by their emotions. I am well aware of the trauma the Soviet occupation inflicted on the Baltic States. What is happening now can be called a hypercompensation of that trauma. I'm sure this reaction will be short-lived. As soon as the war is over, measures will soften.

### Conclusion

But this is not where I want to end, the discrimination of European countries against Russians pales before the real Russophobia in another country. I am talking about Russia. There is no country in the world which more oppresses, imprisons, kills, robs and humiliates Russians. There is no country that more harms Russian culture, that casts a shadow over the great heritage of the Russian people.

When we consider such important and complex topics, it is important to see the big picture. Russian propaganda sets out to narrow your view, to highlight instances of discrimination that take place in Europe, but does not examine the causes of it. It is important to focus on the disease, not the symptoms. Russia does truly terrible things to the people of Ukraine first and to the Russian people second, no discrimination is a significant factor in comparison to these atrocities.
